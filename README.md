# Pokedex Project

This project started as a practice assignment from my web development course.  
I’ve copied the starter code into my own repo so I can continue building on it independently.

The plan is to turn it into a fully personalised project, starting with a complete visual overhaul to match the style of an older, classic Pokédex interface. I’ll also refactor and expand the codebase as I go to make it my own.

## Planned Additions

- Full custom CSS redesign inspired by retro Pokédex UIs
- Updated layout and component structure
- Improved accessibility and responsiveness
- Additional UI states (loading, error, interactions)

## Change Log
